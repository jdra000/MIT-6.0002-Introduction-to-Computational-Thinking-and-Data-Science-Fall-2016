### Problem Set 2
I implemented Dijikstra in my solution so I could practice another algorithm besides DFS and BFS.
#### NOTES: 
#### 1. graph.py model was removed. I chose to represent the graph as an Adjacency List instead.
#### 2. The algorithm is subject to max_time_outdoor constraint, however, the original problem has a total_time constraint too. I am looking forward to add this implementation soon.
