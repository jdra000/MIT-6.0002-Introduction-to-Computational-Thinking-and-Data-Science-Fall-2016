### Problem Set 2
For this problem I implemented Dijikstra so I could practice another algorithm besides DFS and BFS. The graph is represented as an Adjacency List and the function is subject to a maximum time outdoor constraint.
The original problem has an extra total_time constraint. I am looking forward to add this implementation soon.
### Problem Set 4
Simulating the Spread of Disease and Bacteria Population
We put in practice a couple of simulations to explore the effect of introducing antibiotics to the
bacteria population.
### Problem Set 5 ( my favorite one )
Modeling Global Warming to prove Donald Trump wrong.
