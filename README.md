### MIT-6.0002-Introduction-to-Computational-Thinking-and-Data-Science-Fall-2016
Notes and implementations of the topics I used the most and helped me to reinforce and amplify my knowledge in the field.

#### Problem Set 2 (Fastest Way to Get Around MIT)
I used Dijikstra so I could practice another algorithm besides DFS and BFS. The graph is represented as an Adjacency List and the function is subject to a maximum time outdoor constraint.

#### Problem Set 5 (Modeling Global Warming)
##### The required knowledge for ps5 is covered in linear_regression and good_and_bad_models folders.
Applied regression and testing r_squared values for models with different degrees.
