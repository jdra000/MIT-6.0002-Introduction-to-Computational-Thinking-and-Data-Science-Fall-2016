### Problem Set 2
For this problem I implemented Dijikstra so I could practice another algorithm besides DFS and BFS. The graph is represented as an Adjacency List and the function is subject to a maximum time outdoor constraint.
The original problem has an extra total_time constraint. I am looking forward to add this implementation soon.
